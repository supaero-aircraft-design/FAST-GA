==================

- Update release process by @florentLutz

Version 1.2.1
==================

- Now using Poetry 1.4.2 #205 by @florentLutz
- Allowing new version of stdatm #206 by @florentLutz. It is not made use of just yet in this repo

Version 1.2.0
==================

- Made use of the @functools.lru_cache function in order to save time on function that read csv files see #188
- Reworked some of the solvers to save some time and deleted some that were not useful see #195
- Added yml as a viable input for the block analysis
- Development of high wing models by pulling the work of @fomra during his summer 2022 internship
- Implementation of twist and dihedral in logitudinal aerodynamics see #202
- Changed the function of the Cl=f(curve) to match a new reference wing Cl see #202

Version 1.1.0
==================

- Modified the Xfoil interface to allow for single AoA launch see #182
- Modification of the usage of the FlightPoint dataclass so that it is possible to add new fields more easily see #187
- Added a module for the computation of more aerodynamic derivatives see #185

Version 1.0.4
==================

- Added compressibility corrections and reynolds correction in the BEMT code
- Change in the propeller code organization
- Added a new representation of the propeller performance under the form of Ct and Cp graphs
- Centralized all post_processing function in a post-processing API
- Added an option for the path to airfoil files

Version 1.0.3
==================

- Removed unnecessary use of matplotlib in post_processing functions

Version 1.0.2
==================

- Updated binder requirements

Version 1.0.1
==================

- Changed the homepage address in the `pyproject.toml`

Version 1.0.0
==================

- Added an analytical model for wing mass estimation
- Most models are now registered using the submodel feature from FAST-OAD-core
- Added an analytical model for fuselage mass estimation
- Dependencies were updated to reflected the separation between core and models in FAST-OAD
- Generalized the usage of shape_by_conn option when possible
- Added propeller installation effects
- Added link to Binder-hosted notebooks
- Sped up the computation of propeller performances, of aircraft performances and of IC engine fuel consumption
- Added a model for turboprop fuel consumption computation
- Added a new mission modules solves all the FlightPoints at once instead of using a time step approach
- Added Daher TBM900 as a reference aircraft

Version 0.1.4-beta
==================

- Changed the variables that define nacelle position, they are now arrays
- When reading the .csv polar Mach number within a given precision are now read
- Variable descriptions were added
- Minor model error corrections
- Like the **generate_xml_file** was added which creates a default input file that matches what is need in **generate_configuration_file**
- Added polar computation
- Added payload-range diagram computation
- Use of the mission builder feature in FAST-OAD-GA is now possible
- Changed the name of some variables to make the use of the mission builder possible namely: data:geometry:propulsion:count, data:geometry:propulsion:layout, data:geometry:propulsion:y_ratio

Version 0.1.3-beta
==================

- NACA .csv polar files replaced to correct xfoil_polar.py read issues
