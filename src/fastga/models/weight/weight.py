    Computes masses and Centers of Gravity for each part of the empty operating aircraft, among
    these 5 categories:
    airframe, propulsion, systems, furniture, crew

    This model uses MTOW as an input, as it allows to size some elements, but resulting OWE do
    not aim at being consistent with MTOW.

    Consistency between OWE and MTOW can be achieved by cycling with a model that computes MTOW
    from OWE, which should come from a mission computation that will assess needed block fuel.
