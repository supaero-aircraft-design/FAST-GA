    Class to compute the contribution of the wing to the pitch moment coefficient due to pitch
    rate. The vertical distance between the cg and the aerodynamic center of teh plane is taken
    equal to the vertical distance between the root chord and the fuselage centerline. The
    convention from :cite:`roskampart6:1985` are used, meaning that, for the derivative with
    respect to a pitch rate, this rate is made dimensionless by multiplying it by the MAC and
    dividing it by 2 times the airspeed.

    Based on :cite:`gudmundsson:2013`.
