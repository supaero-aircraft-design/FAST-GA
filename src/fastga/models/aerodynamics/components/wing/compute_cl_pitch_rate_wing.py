    Computation of the contribution of the wing to the increase in lift due to a pitch velocity.
    The convention from :cite:`roskampart6:1985` are used, meaning that, for the derivative with
    respect to a pitch rate, this rate is made dimensionless by multiplying it by the MAC and
    dividing it by 2 times the airspeed. The reference point for the CG was taken to be equal to
    the wing quarter chord to match what is taken for other coefficient. If another reference
    point is to be used, this coefficient should be multiplied by (1.0 + 4.0 * x_w / l0_wing)
    with x_w the distance between CG and wing quarter chord, negative when CG is in front of the
    wing quarter chord.

    Based on :cite:`roskampart6:1985` section 10.2.7
